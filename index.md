<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

Chengshun Shang holds a Bachelor's degree in Mining Engineering from Shandong University of Science and Technology (China), awarded in 2018. He later earned his Master's degree in Geotechnical Engineering from Shandong University (China) in 2021. Since 2021, Chengshun has been pursuing his Ph.D. as a candidate at CIMNE, where he actively contributes as a developer to the open-source software Kratos Multiphysics (DEMApplication).

Over the past five years, Chengshun has dedicated his research efforts to the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and its coupling techniques, including DEM-CFD and DEM-FEM. His research primarily revolves around studying rock mechanical behavior and the evolution of geotechnical engineering disasters. His Ph.D. research focuses on establishing a numerical framework based on the Discrete Element Method for modeling the mechanics of both weak and strong sandstone.

**NEED TO BE UPDATED**

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**.

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.</strong></strong>
